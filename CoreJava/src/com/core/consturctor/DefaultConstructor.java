 * Default constructor: Declaring constructors is not required. When we don’t
 * supply any constructor, the Java compiler automatically generates a default
 * constructor which is empty and has no parameters.
 *
 *
 * The compiler won’t generate the default constructor if there’s a already
 * constructor in the class
 * 
 * The default constructor has same access modifier as the class
 * if class is public the access modifier of the default constructor is also public.
